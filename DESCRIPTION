Description: Determining whether one treatment is preferred over others is a major goal of many clinical studies 
  but can be complicated by the situation when no single outcome is sufficient to make the judgement. This package presents
  a useful global statistics test (GST) technique and the corresponding global treatment effect (GTE) measure for 
  assessing treatment's global preference when multiple outcomes are evaluated together.
